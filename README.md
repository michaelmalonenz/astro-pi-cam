This is a web server allowing one to set up a Raspberry Pi Camera somewhere, then remotely control the camera with the minimal amount of fuss.

The main target of this program is for astro photography, which requires that the equipment is not disturbed while in operation (at all!). And often happens at night in the cold.  So if I can set up the telescope outside and then come inside to actually do the imaging and see the results, then so much the better.

I might even do some auto-magic post-processing on the images, like breaking a movie into frames and then avergaging them out.  Of course, that would require relatively short exposure times, so I wouldn't have to figure out how much the sky had moved and end up with a blurry image...
